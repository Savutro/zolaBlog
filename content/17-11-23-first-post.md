#### What is the purpose of this site?

Well if you're reading this you're at least somehow interested in **IT** and **coding**. The purpose of this blog is to document my journey and maybe help someone out by sharing some insight.

So what might be the first topic to talk about? Ehrm... 

Right! What is my background and how did I end up sitting behind a computer all day long. It all began when I was a child. On one Christmas Eve I was gifted a **Nintendo DS Lite**. That's it. I was so fascinated by technology from that day on so that I always wanted to know how things work. That and Gaming. I know it's usually some stigma that all Software Developers do play video games but that's not even that special anymore. Did you know that gaming by now is on it's way to be as profitable as TV shows and music?
